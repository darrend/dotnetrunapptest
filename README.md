trying to see if i can setup a codespace with .net 10 preview 

Fire up a codespace and after it cooks for a bit give it a go in a terminal with `dotnet run hello.cs` or `dotnet run app.cs`

# todo
 install the C# Dev Kit and then follow these instructions to update the C# extension for file-based apps support:
To enable support for file-based apps and directives, you’ll need the latest pre-release version of the C# extension:

Open the Extensions sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+X)
Search for “C#”
In the extension page, click the Switch to Pre-Release Version button
Ensure the version installed is at least 2.79.8
